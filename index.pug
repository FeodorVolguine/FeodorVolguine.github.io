      h2 Hello, welcome to my website.
      br
      p I am a young person with a passion for computer science. This website was made with SASS, Pug, and Javascript. Its purpose is three-fold:
      ul
        li
          p To present my projects and skills in a more detailed, aesthetic way than is possible through a resume.
        li
          p To serve as a centralized, heterogeneous collection of my work across various disciplines.
        li
          p To provide an easily accessible point of contact.
